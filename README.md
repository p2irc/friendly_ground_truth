## Ubuntu
An Ubuntu version of the app can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/KyleS22/friendly_ground_truth/releases/latest/download/friendly_gt-ubuntu.zip).

The zip file contains an executable binary file, an image, and a bash script that will install the application.  

### Copy-pasta:
#### Install
```
wget https://github.com/KyleS22/friendly_ground_truth/releases/latest/download/friendly_gt-ubuntu.zip
unzip friendly_gt-ubuntu.zip
cd friendly_gt_ubuntu
bash install_friendly_gt.sh
```

At this point, if no prompt appears, the application has been installed.

Otherwise:
```
Add ~/bin to your path? (Y/N): yes
Specify bash profile file (blank uses ~/.bashrc): ~/.bash_profile # This can be left blank if you prefer
```

#### Don't Install
```
wget https://github.com/KyleS22/friendly_ground_truth/releases/latest/download/friendly_gt-ubuntu.zip

./friendly_gt_ubuntu-latest
```
## MacOs
A MacOs binary can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/KyleS22/friendly_ground_truth/releases/latest/download/friendly_gt_macos-latest). 

You will need to change the permissions of the binary file to be executable, and then you can run it by double clicking it in the file browser, or by navigating to it in the terminal and typing `./friendly_gt_macos-latest`.

Copy-pasta:
```
wget https://github.com/KyleS22/friendly_ground_truth/releases/latest/download/friendly_gt_macos-latest

# Development
Detailed information about development for this application can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/KyleS22/friendly_ground_truth/wiki)

## Basic Setup
This application is developed using python3 and virtualenv.  Dependencies are found in `requirements.txt`.  To get started:

```
python -m venv env
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

The main entrypoint for the application is `run.py`.  To run it, simply do `python run.py -debug`.  The `-debug` flag is optional and enables logging.

## Tests
Tests have been developed using pytest, with the mocker and coverage modules.  All tests can be found in the `tests/` directory.  To run tests, make sure you are in the main repository folder:

```
pytest --cov=friendly_ground_truth ./tests --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing

```

This will run all tests and print a coverage report specifying any missed lines.  A coverage check is run as part of all pull-requests.

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/KyleS22/friendly_ground_truth/wiki) for more details about the development process.
